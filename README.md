 # ZoomMap

 To cut a long story short, I got a message from a friend saying that there were no JS libraries to let you use an SVG image as a map.  At first I didn't think it true, but then I remembered that `leftpad` happened...

 It's quick, it's hacky, it barely works, and it's better than all the other solutions that don't exist.

### Usage
 Just drop the `.js` file in place, add it to your html, replace `map.svg` with whatever (make sure it has a width and height otherwise Firefox won't like it), and you're good.
